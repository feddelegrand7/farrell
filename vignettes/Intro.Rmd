The goal of farrell is to provide an interactive interface to Data Envelopment Analysis modeling in R. The farrell package is built upon [Benchmarking](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Benchmarking).

## Installation

You can install the development version of farrell from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:



```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/farrell")
```



## Example

You can run: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(farrell)

farrell()

```

or if you're working on RStudio, just click on __Addins__ then __farrell__. 


## Data Loading: 


Hit __Browse...__ to upload your data frame in a csv format. All the inputs and outputs must be contained within the data frame (each column for each input/output). Further, the data frame needs to contain an identification column in order to identify Decision Making Units. It can be a numeric or a character column.

In the following examples, we use the mtcars data frame which has been exported in a csv format with an additional column: __cars name__.

## Model Tuning


![](man/figures/fig3.png)

Within the Model Tuning tab, you will select the input and output variables, then you determine your identification column. Then you choose the Returns to Scale assumption between: crs, vrs, irs, drs, add and fdh. After that, you determine the orientation of the model, whether input or output. Finally, hit __Calculate Efficiency__ to get the results. 

Let's for example consider __mpg__ and __disp__ as the output variables and __wt__ as input. We choose __cars name__ as the identification column and model an input-oriented model with crs assumption.

## Efficiency Results


The Efficiency Results tab displays the efficiency scores along with the peers for each unit in a descending order. You have the ability to download the result in a csv format. The tab also provides a summary of the distribution of the efficiency scores.

## Lambdas


Finally, in the Lambdas tab, you get the contribution of the peers to the inefficient units' score.
